# Optimized-sgRNA-Design

![](datafiles/CRISPR-Logo.jpg)

This is a set of software tools for analyzing the on-target and off-target effects of sgRNA spacer inputs

This program is still currently under development. Intended functionality is that this program can take in a metagenome consisting of a large number of organisms' genetic data, along with a desired region of interest to be isolated, and output several 20-base-pair sgRNA spacers ranked in terms of optimality.
